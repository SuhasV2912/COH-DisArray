# CoHDisArray

Problem Statement:
Many individuals find themselves in distress or emergency situations without immediate access to assistance. In such scenarios, notifying friends or family members quickly can be challenging, potentially delaying crucial help.

Solution:
To address this issue, we have developed an application that streamlines the process of alerting emergency contacts. Users can compile a list of trusted contacts within the app. In times of distress, a simple button press triggers the app to send an SOS message, including the user's current location, to all designated contacts simultaneously. This swift alert system ensures that necessary assistance can be mobilized promptly, potentially saving lives.
